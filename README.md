# PROG 02: Represent!

Represent! is an Android mobile phone and watch application that allows you to get to know your representatives,
see what they are doing to help you, and contact them when you need. You can also see how your county voted in
the previous Presidential election, as well as find the representatives for a random location in the US.

Here is the phone view when you first open the app. Users have the ability to input a zip code, or
use the GPS in their phone to determine their current location.

Here is the screen when you first open the app on the watch. The user is required to first enter their
location on the phone before they can interact further on the watch.

Here is the view when after you have entered you location on the phone. As you can see, there is a list of cards,
where each card contains information about a representative. The information includes their picture, name, party, role,
state, latest tweet (if they have a twitter account), as well as links to their email and website.

scroll through the representatives.

Here is the more detailed view for representatives. This is reached by pressing the "More Info" button on
the representative's card in the list activity. Users can view the representative's bills, committees, and when
their term comes to an end, on top of other information that was on their card.

Here is the view on the watch to launch a representatives detailed view on the phone. This is viewable by swiping to the
left on a representative in the previous watch view. I made a large and clearly labeled button so that users know
exactly what to expect when they press it.

Here is the 2012  Vote View for the user's county. This is viewable by swiping to the left from the launch on phone view
for the representative that is in the House of Representatives. This is not viewable for reps who are senators. The
information includes the county name and state, as well as the percent vote for President Obama and Mitt Romney for that
county.

This is the Toast message that is shown when the user shakes their wrist. This sends a message to the phone to randomize
the location and refresh the data.

This is the Toast message that is shown on the phone after the user has shaken their wrist with the watch on. This
displays the new longitude and latitude that is being used to lookup the representative information.
